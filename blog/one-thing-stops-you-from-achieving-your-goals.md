I have observed this problem in 99% of people around me which is normally ignored.

# The Problem

I call this thing Bull-Shit Thoughts, before you even begin to start anything new in your life, you start thinking about problems which you can’t control. 

“Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems.” ~ Epictetus

For example, I suggested to my juniors in college to start freelancing, and they started getting a lot concerned, ‘What if a client didn’t pay me?’ 

I told them to just start and gain experience, everyone gets cheated once in their lifetime. That doesn’t mean you won’t start freelancing.

Once I told my friend that we both could make short films, and he was concerned about whether people would watch our short films. and what if we didn’t make any money? 

These are a few classic examples of Bull-Shit Thoughts, you haven’t started yet and you are concerned about the problems which don't even exist.

We humans have a very bad habit of making things overly complicated. This might be just our survival mechanism to keep ourselves in our comfort zone.

# The Solution

You should understand that starting anything new when you are a total beginner will be a bit hard. You will make a lot of small and big mistakes but don’t treat your mistakes as your failure.

## Stoicism

Stoicism teaches us that most of our suffering happens in our imagination. So reject all the Bull-Shit thoughts you get.

“We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.” ~ Seneca

## Law of Karma

There is a very popular philosophy of Karma in Hinduism and Buddhism. It has many definitions, but the best one I liked is that you are free to do anything you want, it can be good or bad, but results are not in your control. 

If you have worked hard then one thing is sure you will get results, Your every action counts. 

So don’t get depressed about results, work hard as much as you can and leave the rest to God. Detach yourself from the results.

“You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.” ~ Bhagavad Geeta
