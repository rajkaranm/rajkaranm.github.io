# How to Start Your Programming Journey.

If you planing to start with programming by watching some movies that fantasizing programming them wait for second and think again, Because in reality, Programming is very different, Most of the you are going to frustrated solving a coding problem.

But if have specific goal or you want earn a lot money then, Off course this field have a great potential.But you have to be a problem solver, Because if you look deeply, You are solving a lot of problems of the company that you will join or a customer you got on freelancing website.

So be prepared to face hell, because starting to learn coding is very hard most the people give up in the first stage but the people are able to overcome this phase are real hard working and problem solvers.

## Step 1: Decide Your Goals
It's not a rocket science, Before starting anything have a goal in mind so that you can track your progress.

Pick a paper or digital notes app like google keep and down down your long term goals like "having Net worth of 10M Dollsrs", But be real and some achievable big goals.And long term goals doesn't have to be very specific. Just write what comes in your mind.

Then make medium term, where you will be specific about your goals how your going to achieve 10M Dollars.Are you going to run a start up or you are going to work for corporate compaies which will pay you very high.

Then make short term goals where you are really going to take action like learning about business and startup or finding an idea.

With short term goals you are going to achieve medium term goals and which medium term goals you going to achieve long term goals.


And Remember your short term goals may change situations to situations so don't get panic.

## Step 2: Pick a programmming language.
If you  want a straight answer to this question, then pick C programming, If totally new to this field then belive me C programming will create the base of your understanding of programming.

I started my journey with C programming and till now i gratefull because most of high level programming are build on C programming and most of the langauge style(syntax) is inspired by C programming.

I learning C programming, Learning python was just a peice of cake for me.With C programming you can't build websites or mobile app. But for beginner like you it will clear build the base that is required for newbies.

## Step 3: Start with a Field.

There are many field programming where you go, Like Web Development, Data Science, Mobile Development, Game Development, etc.


You have specific goal in mind then it's good. But if you don't have any idea then start with ** web development ** or Data Science, For 2023 AI is on boom, So there will be a lot of opportunity for data scientist.So pick ** Data Science ** if you can because in data Science there will be a lot of Maths.

So if you guy who doesn't like maths or just want to get started with ease then go with web development.

## Step 4: Learn.

Search for two or three good resources and start learning don't go for tutorial hell, where you just learning and not building something real.

After learning try to implement something new with the knowledge you have gained.Build a lot of good and creative projects.Don't ever put calculator App in your resume.


## Step 5: Learn Git and Github.

  Don't get confuse by there name, Git is version control tool for your project, You can manage different version of your app like V1.1 or V1.2, If you get problem in version V1.2 then you can go back to version V1.1.

And Github is website were you publish your code other coders or recruiter can view your projects. 

Git is very important tool used by almost in every programming project.So you have to learn it, You don't have choice.

## Step 6: Read.
Read Articles as much as you can about programming or related to programming, one good place is medium.

Because it will increase your knowledge exponentially, Trust me this can be a game changer for you, The knowledge you will learn daily will way more high quality then on Youtube Short or any short content you are consuming.

Also read non - technical books soft skill.I am telling this, This book can boost your career and mindset, which will help you to grow in your life.

## Step 7: Explore and be patient.


Explore daily new things about programming and new tools to improve your workflow.At these level you will be smart enough to explore things on your own.

Last thing be patient, You can't achieve anything overnight. Just focus on your long term goal and be consistent daily in programming.
