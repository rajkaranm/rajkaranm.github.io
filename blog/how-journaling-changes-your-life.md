Why does writing your thoughts and ideas down matter? 

I also had the same question before I started journaling, but now I think, starting to journal was my best decision. 

It works because you write down the thoughts and ideas which were floating in your mind, This thought may bother you. 

When you write them down, it tricks your brain into thinking it will be taken care of. Now your mind doesn’t have to hold it. 

It works on all kinds of thoughts and ideas. 

# Why should you write a journal? 

A simple answer to general people would be to reduce your stress, it has been observed that journaling reduces stress levels. 

Imagine you had a terrible day in your office, if you write it down in your journal then your mind will stop bothering about it to some extent. 

Your journal is your personal space to confess your feelings and emotions. 

If you are a businessman, content creator, writer or any field where you have to solve a creative problem then journaling is by far the best free tool you can keep in your arsenal, because you will get great clarity about your ideas. 

One amazing benefit of journaling is that you are documenting your life, which you and your future generations can read and enjoy the beautiful memories. 

# How to Journal? 

The magic of journaling will only feel when you start writing. Many people will write a few lines and complain it’s not working. 

You should completely engage with the process of writing in a journal. 

## 1 - Write About Your Achievements 

Start by just writing down your achievements. You have to be detailed about everything. 

You can also write about any incident that happens in your life. 

## 2 – Write How things Should Have Went 

After you get a bit used to writing then start writing how things should have gone. What things went wrong from your side? What did you learn from this incident? 

You have to reflect here, you have to increase your understanding and dive deep into what you are doing. 

## 3 – Write About the inner logic of your life, the Bigger Picture. 

Now here most people are afraid of it because here you will face heavy questions like, who am I? What is my purpose? Why do I even exist? 

This is where you will work on the bigger picture of your life. 

# My Process 

I keep two journals, one for daily tracking of my tasks and work, and one for structure. Another for just writing down ideas, thoughts and feelings, the unstructured one. 

I think the 2 journal method is the best because you get massive flexibility with your journalling. 

Every morning, when I wake up, I write at least one page about how things are going. how I’m feeling writing now? Do I have any ideas about my dream? 

I would recommend making your questions for the morning pages because someone else’s system may not work for you. 

# Conclusion 

If you are in a creative field then you can’t ignore journaling, for writers, it must do things. 

The general audience can also get a lot of benefits from journaling, so developing a new habit of writing will be great in 2024.
