In this article we will discuss why JavaScript developers are so active, Why you should do this too and some resources to stay updated. I like to keep things simple.

# Why JavaScript Developers are So Active?

Well if you visit twitter then you will figure out that JavaScript community is very active, Reason is, Regularly a lot new JavaScript framework releases and Many existing frameworks get a lot major updates. 

Just frontend UI framework in JS have hell lot of frameworks like ReactJS, Angular, VueJS, Svelte, Chad NextJS and many more.


These are just frontend libraries, There are a lot JS Framework to learn like NodeJs. So regularly JS Ecosystem of frameworks changes. If you are not a active person in JS then there a lot chance that your **skills would be no longer in demand**.

### Let's take a Example

Now Vanilla React or Plain React is not recommend to use by Facebook, because there are other frameworks like NextJs build on the top of ReactJS provide great out of the box features like File System Routing.


Which is not present in Vanilla React, If you want routing feature in React then you have to install React-Router-Dom.

And to put cherry on the top, React-Router-Dom get major changes on monthly or weekly basis, You have visit the official documentation to adapt in new way React-Router-Dom works.

For beginners, It's really annoying to start a new project and you find out that the library you recently worked is now fully updated and they have totally new way doing everything now.




# What to do in this rapidly changing JS frameworks?

Some people suggest, One solution is to stick to the version of the library you worked on and have complete knowledge of that version. 

But in my opinion, this will only work when you try to make personal projects because if you join a new company and you figure out that company is using latest version **React-Router-Dom**.

Now for sure you have to learn the new changes adapted by the library. 

So you know what, In my experience I have understood one thing if you are a JavaScript developer then visiting the official documentation of frameworks you work with is inevitable.

Today or tomorrow or Day after tomorrow you will have to **visit the official documentation**, This is reality, So don't regret now for becoming JavaScript developer, Instead build a habit of reading documentation, 

Slowly but one day it will be become easy for you understand documentation. And with this habit you are really become a good developer.  

**ChatGPT**, **YouTube** and  **Stack Overflow** are your best friends if you don't like reading official documentation or you got stuck.



# What I do to stay updated?

Well its not a rocket science, I simple try to visit **Twitter** regular and I follow all the frameworks I work with like [NextJs](https://twitter.com/nextjs) , Plus I also follow the official blogs of framework I work with, Like [NextJs blog](https://nextjs.org/blog).


Then I follow Code Report of [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) channel on YouTube, If you are JavaScript developer then you must subscribe this man, He has some great content on this channel.

Then there is one more channel named [codedamn](https://www.youtube.com/@codedamn). He talk about technologies and give insights about frameworks and services like AWS and Vercel.

**Conclusion**: Being a lot active as a JavaScript developer is a need, We can't avoid it, This shouldn't be a pain point, instead you should look it as a opportunity to learn something new.
