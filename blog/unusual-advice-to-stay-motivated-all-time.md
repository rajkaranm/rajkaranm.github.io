We all have experienced a lack of motivation to do certain important things, we either intentionally get distracted or procrastinate. 

But one day when I was reading the book “Show Your Work” by Austin Kleon, In Chapter 1 itself author explores the near-death experiences of various people which changed their lives completely. 

In our daily life forget the basic fact of life, that one day we are going to die.

Some people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75. 

– Benjamin Franklin

That’s why to cheer us up, Many philosophers have attached positivity around death like Death frees us from pain and the theory of reincarnation.

But the fact remains the same, we are going to die one day, isn’t it a humiliation to us?

To make life worth we do meaningful things, so people don’t forget us. We will live inside the memories of the people.

But we ignore this fact and delay our meaningful work. To overcome this, Austin Kleon explains the idea of reading obituaries in the morning, so we can keep ourselves reminded that one day we going to be deleted from this beautiful world.

Do you know about Robert James Fischer, Also known as Bobby Fischer, He was an American Chess Grandmaster, Who single-handedly destroyed the dominance of the Soviet Union in chess.

He had a very tragic life, Many people claim that the show Queen’s Gambit was inspired by this life.

When I knew about him, I became his fan, But hardly ever noticed the fact that he was dead :(

He died on 17 January 2008, At the age of 64, The Chessboard had 64 squares in it, quite an unusual coincidence. 

The point here is to get depressed by this. The point here is to remind yourself about the limited time you have and generate motivation to do your work.

When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love. 

– Marcus Aurelius

Batman was able to escape from the pit only when he tried without the rope.

 **“Because the fear of death is the ultimate motivation”**
